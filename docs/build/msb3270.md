# MSB3270 architecture mismatch with .NET 3.5 reference assemblies

When the project is built on Windows with the official `Microsoft.NETFramework.ReferenceAssemblies.net35`
package, MSBuild resolves `mscorlib.dll`, `System.Data.dll`, and the rest of the CLR 2.0 surface area as
32‑bit (`ProcessorArchitecture=x86`). Those assemblies actually contain platform‑agnostic IL, but they were
produced before AnyCPU became the norm and therefore carry the legacy metadata. Because our mod is
compiled as AnyCPU so that it can load in Cities: Skylines' 64‑bit Mono runtime, the metadata mismatch
triggers MSB3270 during `ResolveAssemblyReference`.

The project file now disables the SDK's implicit framework references and re‑adds the same assemblies with
explicit `ProcessorArchitecture=MSIL` metadata so that MSBuild understands they are architecture neutral.
This preserves the official .NET 3.5 API surface from the NuGet package while eliminating the spurious
warning. If MSBuild ever resolves a framework assembly with a different architecture again we only need to
update the manual list in `CSM.TmpeSync.csproj`.
